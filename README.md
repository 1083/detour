# U.S. Detour

U.S. Detour is a curated collection of
definitive, high-quality, well-designed products,
all made in the United States.

## Design

The single page layout promotes casual browsing,
without excessive nesting and over-organization.

There are currently ~20 listed products and >20 lined up.
We&rsquo;re waiting to see when we hit the limits of the one page;
right now, each product addition tends to shift the organization of
&ldquo;departments&rdquo; (top-level categories) and
&ldquo;aisles&rdquo; (sub-categories).

Since everything comes from America,
we&rsquo;re including the specific state where the item was produced.

Country of origin [affects consumers&rsquo; evaluation of product attributes]
(http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3172608?uid=3739712&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21105286754253),
and we&rsquo;re curious to explore higher-resolution
&ldquo;supply-side marketing.&rdquo;

## Implementation

Check out the HTML&mdash;it&rsquo;s more minimal than Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s
[first webpage](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).
I&rsquo;ve tried to isolate only the minimum necessary markup features,
from HTML ["1.2"](http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt) to 5.1.

I&rsquo;ve&rsquo;nt intentionally limited usage of recent CSS features
(e.g. there are media queries)
but most of the design has been in terms of typography,
focused on long-term usability over passing prettiness.

It renders well in IE 4.0 (released in October 1997) and
[NetFront](http://gl.access-company.com/products/browser/browser/) 4.2.

Though TBL [didn&rsquo;t intend HTML to be written directly](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html)
[*Weaving the Web*, first edition, page 42],
that was how I got into software development,
back in junior high, around the turn of the millennium.
After spending the better part of this decade hacking MEAN and LAMP,
it&rsquo;s been thoroughly refreshing to focus exclusively on design and content,
suppressing my impulse to abstract and encapsulate and otherwise prematurely automate.
