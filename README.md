# U.S. Detour

U.S. Detour is a curated collection of
definitive, high-quality, well-designed products,
all made in the United States.

## Mission

Our mission is to tell the real story of products:
how they're made, who makes them, and why they do so.
The history of the manufacturers,
intricacies of form and function,
focusing on the act of creation,
quality craftsmanship,
and timeless design.

We want to shift attention to realities,
over trite advertising fictions.

We see an alternative to the parade of hallow brands,
the bogus hyped virtues and features,
the derisive assertions that your life is incomplete without some thing.

We're surrounded by multitudes of stuff,
in the middle of an unprecedented historical shift from scarcity to plenty.
This abbundance is overwhelming; with so many options,
deciding has become the difficulty.

Why choose any single product over another?
Price? Appearance? Durability?

We believe the real story matters more:
where it's made,
who makes it,
why they do so,
how long they've been making it,
and how long it'll last.

Initially we're merely presenting a collection of products,
with simple descriptions and straightforward layout.
As we grow, we want to delve deeper into the producers and their products,
showing how and where they're made,
what you can do with them,
and their place in history.

## Design

The single page layout promotes casual browsing,
without excessive nesting and over-organization.

There are currently ~20 listed products and >20 lined up.
We&rsquo;re waiting to see when we hit the limits of the one page;
right now, each product addition tends to shift the organization of
&ldquo;departments&rdquo; (top-level categories) and
&ldquo;aisles&rdquo; (sub-categories).

Since everything comes from America,
we&rsquo;re including the specific state where the item was produced.

Country of origin [affects consumers&rsquo; evaluation of product attributes]
(http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3172608?uid=3739712&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21105286754253),
and we&rsquo;re curious to explore higher-resolution
&ldquo;supply-side marketing.&rdquo;

## Implementation

Check out the HTML&mdash;it&rsquo;s more minimal than Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s
[first webpage](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).
I&rsquo;ve tried to isolate only the minimum necessary markup features,
from HTML ["1.2"](http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt) to 5.1.

I&rsquo;ve&rsquo;nt intentionally limited usage of recent CSS features
(e.g. there are media queries)
but most of the design has been in terms of typography,
focused on long-term usability over passing prettiness.

It renders well in IE 4.0 (released in October 1997) and
[NetFront](http://gl.access-company.com/products/browser/browser/) 4.2.

Though TBL [didn&rsquo;t intend HTML to be written directly](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html)
[*Weaving the Web*, first edition, page 42],
that was how I got into software development,
back in junior high, around the turn of the millennium.
After spending the better part of this decade hacking MEAN and LAMP,
it&rsquo;s been thoroughly refreshing to focus exclusively on design and content,
suppressing my impulse to abstract and encapsulate and otherwise prematurely automate.
