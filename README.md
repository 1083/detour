# Detour Collection

The Detour Collection is an experiment in
UI/UX design and web development methodology.

## Design

The single page layout promotes casual browsing,
without excessive nesting and over-organization.

There are currently only 13 products,
with another baker&rsquo;s dozen or two lined up,
and we&rsquo;re waiting to see when we hit the
limits of the one page.

The products included are meant to be
definitive, high-quality, and well-designed,
all made in the U.S.

Since everything comes from America,
we&rsquo;re including the specific state where the item was produced.

Country of origin [affects consumers&rsquo; evaluation of product attributes](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3172608?uid=3739712&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21105286754253),
and we&rsquo;re curious about higher-resolution &ldquo;supply-side marketing.&rdquo;

## Implementation

Take a peek at the HTML&mdash;it&rsquo;s about as minimal as Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s
[first webpage](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).
Aside from the `meta` & `span` elements and
`id` & `class` attributes,
the markup seems to adhere to the
["HTML 1.2"](http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt)
spec from June 1993.

I&rsquo;ve&rsquo;nt intentionally limited usage of recent CSS features
(e.g. there are media queries)
but the design efforts have mostly been directed to typography,
and usability over "beauty".

It renders well in IE 4.0 (released in October 1997) and
[NetFront](http://gl.access-company.com/products/browser/browser/) 4.2.

Try disabling CSS.
And you won&rsquo;t find one line of JS.

Though TBL [didn&rsquo;t intend HTML to be written directly](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html)
[*Weaving the Web*, first edition, page 42],
that was how I got into software development,
back in junior high, around the turn of the millennium.
After spending the better part of this decade hacking MEAN and LAMP,
it&rsquo;s been thoroughly refreshing to focus exclusively on design and content,
suppressing my impulse to abstract and encapsulate and otherwise prematurely automate.
